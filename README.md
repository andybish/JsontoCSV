# JsontoCSV
Quick JSON to CSV converter in python

Set headers and filename manually.
Will convert filename.json to filename.csv.
Will no longer leave blank rows between data rows.
Will output total row count, and number of each header field that were not found and replaced with blanks.
Not at all optimised, if you have large JSONs, have a lot of RAM.
